These steps are useful for case, when there are 3 selections of artworks:
- Recently used
- Used
- Unused

1. Copy "C:\Users\Edik\Desktop\imagestemp\new" 
to 
"C:\Users\Edik\PycharmProjects\VkAutoposter\src\projects\{project_name}\images_new"

2. Run application to fill the DB with existing artworks

3. Run SQL: //Create doubled fake activity for the artworks
INSERT INTO activity_log(artwork_id) 
SELECT id FROM {project_name}
INSERT INTO activity_log(artwork_id) 
SELECT id FROM {project_name}

4. Copy "C:\Users\Edik\Desktop\imagestemp\{except 'new'}" 
to 
"C:\Users\Edik\PycharmProjects\VkAutoposter\src\projects\{project_name}\images_new"

5. Run application to fill the DB with existing artworks

6. Run SQL: //Create fake activity for these new artworks
INSERT INTO activity_log(artwork_id) 
SELECT {project_name}.id FROM {project_name}
LEFT JOIN activity_log ON {project_name}.id = activity_log.artwork_id
WHERE activity_log.id IS NULL

7. Copy "C:\Users\Edik\Desktop\{project_name}_unused" 
to 
"C:\Users\Edik\PycharmProjects\VkAutoposter\src\projects\{project_name}\images_new"

8. Add all necessary tags to the artworks from step7

9. Run application to fill the DB with existing artworks

10. Now you can use the application normally
